   Beatboxing data set "beatboxset1"
   Collected 2008 by Dan Stowell, Queen Mary University of London

-------ABOUT-------

This dataset contains beatboxing (vocal percussion) recordings from various 
contributors, who recorded the clips themselves in various conditions. The clips
were provided by users of the website http://www.humanbeatbox.com/ and are 
identified by the names they use on that forum. Each clip is from a different
contributor.

The accompanying spreadsheet file "beatboxset1.csv" provides metadata for the 
recordings.

Clips were sourced in two slightly different ways, identified by the "Source"
field in the spreadsheet:

  c - "callout" - contributors responded to a specific callout in which we 
         asked for approx 30-second clips, specifically featuring 
         the 3 most common beatbox sounds: kicks, snares, hats.
         http://www.humanbeatbox.com/forum/showthread.php?t=48723
         
  o - "other" - recordings were published online for other purposes, and 
         having checked that the recordings matched our criteria, we 
         obtained permission to use them in our dataset.

Only uncompressed WAV-format audio clips are included. There is some variation 
in exact format (44100 or 22050 Hz, mono or stereo); we have not postprocessed
the clips.

-------ANNOTATIONS-------

Annotations of the beatbox data were made in June-July 2009 by two independent
annotators:
 * Helena du Toit
 * Diako Rasoul

Individual event onset locations were annotated, along with a category label. 
The labels' meanings are:

 * k  = kick
 * hc = hihat, closed
 * ho = hihat, open
 * sb = snare, "bish" or "pss" -like
 * sk = snare, "k" -like  (may sound like a "clap" or "rimshot" snare)
 * s  = snare but not sure which of the above types (or isn't either of them)
 * br = a breath sound (not intended to sound like percussion)
 * m  = humming (or similar, a note with no drum-like or speech-like nature)
 * v  = speech or singing
 * x  = miscellaneous other sound (identifiable, but not fitting one of 
                                    the other categories)
 * ?  = unsure of classification

Files were annotated using Sonic Visualiser 1.5 <http://sonicvisualiser.org>,
via a combination of listening and inspecting waveforms/spectrograms. Each 
person's annotations are provided in a subfolder indicated by their initials.
Each annotation file is a CSV file with two columns: time offset in seconds
and classification.
